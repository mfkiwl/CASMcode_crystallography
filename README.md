#### libcasm-xtal

The libcasm-xtal package is the CASM crystallography module. This includes:

- Data structures for representing lattices, crystal structures, and
  degrees of freedom (DoF).
- Methods for enumerating superlattices, making super structures, finding primitive and reduced cells, and finding symmetry operations.


#### Install

    pip install libcasm-xtal


#### Usage

See the [libcasm-xtal docs](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_pydocs/libcasm/xtal/2.0/html/index.html).


#### About CASM

The libcasm-xtal package is part of the [CASM](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_docs/) open source software package, which is designed to perform first-principles statistical mechanical studies of multi-component crystalline solids.

CASM is developed by the Van der Ven group, originally at the University of Michigan and currently at the University of California Santa Barbara.
